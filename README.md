# My learnings
- Development of a full angular app.
- Angular routing (default routing, route parameters to use an specific parameter of the route to use it in the app, and not found route).
- Angular components and modules (property and event binding, interpolation).
- Communication between components with Input/Output decorators and binding.
- Conditional display of components and html objects (ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch).
- Angular HttpClient to make requests (API).
- Angular services (injectables, with observable vars).
- TypeScript interfaces.
- tailwind class styles.
- Netlify deployment with client side routing.
